        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biology Major üî¨Ô∏è</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a current sophomore Biology major studying at University of California, Riverside. I am orginally from the Bay Area, specifically San Jose. I have taken numerous science classes throughout college and have a good background in Chemistry, Biology, Psychology, and Physics. My freshman year I participated in lab research for about ten weeks under Dr. David Nelson. I mutated Arabidopsis thaliana to see how plant growth is affected by karrikins. Due to this experience, I am now able to perform basic chemistry and biology lab techniques, DNA Sequencing, and PCR amplification. I was also able to expand my technology skills and become familiar with Microsoft Office and other various graphing softwares. My second lab exprience was with Psychology, in which I took part in many studies offered around campus and served as a research participant. Additionally in high school, I took an Intro to Computer Science course, so I have aquired some experience with the language C++ and worked with the computing platform Arduino.
<br><br>

        I aspire to become a physician in the future and hope to find my home in the medical field setting. Due to my passion and interest in becoming a doctor, I took the chance to shadow a variety of medical professionals. I also have a good amount of experience with volunteering in hospitals. The first hospital I volunteered at was Washington Hospital, located in Fremont CA. I worked as a gift shop volunteer where I interacted with and comforted both patients and their families. We would occasionally deliver flowers to patients' rooms as well. Working as a gift shop volunteer also allowed me to attain retail experience. My next experience was shadowing Dr. Vani Velkuru where I gained clinical experience interacting with patients with many musculoskeletal disorders and engaged in diagnoses. I then proceeded onto the optometrist setting, as I want to get exposure to the various health professional settings. During the summer of 2019, I shadowed Dr. David Schymeinsky where I gained insight about various eye procedures (LASIK, PRK, cataract and glaucoma surgery) and learned basic eye diagnosis. Currently, I am a part of the competitive club Shadow MD, which gives students addtional opportunities to shadow doctors. I am currently shaodwing Dr. Michael Bishara, an internal medicine specialist and Dr. Attar Naseem, a general surgeon specialist. Due to these various opportunities, I am very familiar with clinical settings and have observed various diagnoses. 
<br><br>

        Overall, I am a very open-minded, curious, committed, and hardworking individual looking to serve my community in the future as a pediatrician. I have always had a special connection with kids and have loved babysitting my family friends and little cousins. I truly value and love kids and want to make a difference in their lives. It is very important to me that everyone stays healthy in the future and I want to do my best to prevent any possible illness. I also want to eliminate the high costs of healthcare and hope to help out those who are underpriveledged in any way I can.
